## ðŸŽ§ Spotify Mood Insights
Turning raw Spotify data into emotionally intelligent, personalized music recommendations through machine learning.

## Inspiration
What if Spotify could understand not just what you like, but how you feel?

Music is emotional, personal, and deeply tied to our moods. Yet many recommendations today are driven by popularity or surface-level similarity. We were inspired to build a system that taps into the emotional core of music, helping users reflect on their listening habits, discover emotion-aligned content, and helping platforms like Spotify deliver more transparent, human-centered experiences.

We asked ourselves:

Can machine learning help uncover deeper emotional trends in our listening patterns?

Can it guide users toward content that resonates more deeply with their mood or current state?

Can it help music companies discover undervalued songs or promote underrepresented genres?

## Problem Statement
Users often struggle to understand their own taste or find new songs that align with their current mood.

Music platforms tend to push popular or generic content, often missing opportunities to delight users with emotionally aligned recommendations.

Undiscovered or niche artists often go unnoticed due to lack of surface-level popularity.

We aim to solve this by:

Using machine learning (clustering) to group tracks by mood-related features (e.g, energy, valence, danceability).

Helping users visually explore and reflect on their listening history.

Identifying emotional blind spots (e.g, always listening to sad music?).

Offering insights that could shape next-gen music personalization tools.

### Dataset
We use the [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset) from Kaggle, which contains rich metadata for thousands of songs, including:

User-facing attributes: popularity, explicit, genre

Acoustic features: energy, danceability, valence, tempo, instrumentalness, acousticness, etc.

Contextual info: artist, album, track ID

This dataset provides the ideal foundation for mood-based music analysis and ML experimentation.

##   Stakeholders
Primary:
Spotify Users â€“ Seeking personalized, emotionally intelligent recommendations

Music Enthusiasts â€“ Wanting to reflect on their listening patterns and discover new genres

Content Creators & Artists â€“ Hoping to be discovered through non-popularity-based signals

Secondary:
Music Streaming Platforms â€“ Looking to improve user retention and satisfaction

Marketers & Labels â€“ Interested in targeting the right songs to the right listeners

Mental Wellness Platforms â€“ Integrating emotionally relevant soundscapes

## Impact
This project aims to:

Help users emotionally connect with their listening history

Drive diversity in recommendations, reducing overexposure to just top hits

Support underrepresented artists by surfacing songs aligned with unique listener moods

Enable smarter business decisions by identifying gaps in mood coverage or emotional tone in content

We believe that data-driven music experiences should be as personal, diverse, and dynamic as the people who listen.
